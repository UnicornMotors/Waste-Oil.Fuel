>First, this article does have a bias toward biodiesel because it is my personal opinion that using biodiesel is a superior fuel to WVO and that using biodiesel is better for most people.  I have included links at the bottom for those who want to see examples of WVO conversions or want to learn more.  Here is a quick list of pros and cons comparing biodiesel and WVO.  Please note that the pros and cons are specific to the VW TDI only!  **The cons of WVO used in a light duty VW TDI are not the same as WVO used in an inline pump Mercedes Benz or older Dodge Cummins Ram.**  It is possible to use WVO in a VW TDI successfully for many years, but the odds and the experiences of others strongly suggest that biodiesel is a better option.
