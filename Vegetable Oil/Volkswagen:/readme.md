>First, this article does have a bias toward biodiesel because it is my personal opinion that using biodiesel is a superior fuel to WVO and that using biodiesel is better for most people.  I have included links at the bottom for those who want to see examples of WVO conversions or want to learn more.  Here is a quick list of pros and cons comparing biodiesel and WVO.  Please note that the pros and cons are specific to the VW TDI only!  **The cons of WVO used in a light duty VW TDI are not the same as WVO used in an inline pump Mercedes Benz or older Dodge Cummins Ram.**  It is possible to use WVO in a VW TDI successfully for many years, but the odds and the experiences of others strongly suggest that biodiesel is a better option.

>As you can see, the only major advantage that WVO has over biodiesel is that you don't have to process it with chemicals.  It still has to be collected, filtered, and settled.  In my opinion, a much better option is to process the WVO into biodiesel because it is better for the engine, turbo, and fuel pump due to viscosity and temperature, better for emissions, better for the engine oil, and requires no modification to the car.  Again, it is possible to successfully use WVO and not have a problem but there is less chance of having problems with biodiesel.  WVO supporters say that a diesel engine demonstration showed a diesel running on peanut oil during the early days of automobiles.  Back then, engines were less powerful, much simpler, and didn't last very long.  Today, high pressure direct fuel injection, higher combustion pressures, and expectations of cars running 200,000+ miles, in my opinion, make WVO a poor choice for VW TDI.
