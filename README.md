>Why it Works
>Petroleum is made up of two basic types of molecules, straight chains and rings. However there are also rings with chains. Ring type molecules make good gasoline blends and resist detonation during the engine's compression stroke. Longer chains are known as “knockers” as they easily detonate and cause a gasoline engine to knock. This is bad for a gasoline motor but good for diesel engines so diesel fuel has chain type molecules as opposed to rings.

>When fuel is made, the lighter compounds that form gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene are distilled off. The heavier residue that remains contains long chains that if distilled under higher temperature and pressure, crack or break in half to form shorter chains that make diesel fuel. If distilled under vacuum at low temperatures, they come out as longer chains good for lubricating oil. So the main difference between diesel fuel and lubricating oil, is the length of the chain. However the longer chains make for thick oil that must be thinned and this is exactly the way diesel was made for many years. Heavier bottoms were blended with lighter oils to thin them enough to run in diesel engines.
