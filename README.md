>Why it Works
>Petroleum is made up of two basic types of molecules, straight chains and rings. However there are also rings with chains. Ring type molecules make good gasoline blends and resist detonation during the engine's compression stroke. Longer chains are known as “knockers” as they easily detonate and cause a gasoline engine to knock. This is bad for a gasoline motor but good for diesel engines so diesel fuel has chain type molecules as opposed to rings.
>
>When fuel is made, the lighter compounds that form gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene are distilled off. The heavier residue that remains contains long chains that if distilled under higher temperature and pressure, crack or break in half to form shorter chains that make diesel fuel. If distilled under vacuum at low temperatures, they come out as longer chains good for lubricating oil. So the main difference between diesel fuel and lubricating oil, is the length of the chain. However the longer chains make for thick oil that must be thinned and this is exactly the way diesel was made for many years. Heavier bottoms were blended with lighter oils to thin them enough to run in diesel engines.

>Hot oil is a very good thing when it comes to cleaning and 160°F up to about 220°F degrees is an ideal range. The hotter the better! Oil thins quickly with heat and it also helps separate the water. You may look at that dark black oil and think it's dry but you have been fooled. There is still a significant amount of water in it. This is due to the detergents in the oil that hold the water in suspension. Because water is heavier than oil, it will come out in the centrifuge. The US Filtermaxx centrifuge creates a slight vacuum in the bowl, this and the fine spray created inside the centrifuge causes water to flash off as steam. If this steam was allowed to stay in the centrifuge, a large percentage would condense back into the oil as water. If the vapors are forced out of the centrifuge, then there is little chance for them to re-contaminate the oil. US Filtermaxx centrifuges are force ventilated to remove this water and other vapors coming from the hot oil.

>Blending Agent / Solvent Options
Now you are ready to blend the oil to reduce the viscosity. There are many things or “solvents” that may be used, regular gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel and diesel. There are reasons you don't want to use other solvents like acetone or toluene except as maybe an occasional fuel system cleaner.

>Diesel is a common solvent and every 10 percent addition reduces the oil viscosity by one third.
>
>Gasoline is a powerful solvent and every 10 percent addition cuts the viscosity by half. Heavy oil is slower burning. Gasoline also increases the burn rate. These two properties make it my solvent of choice.

>Mixing Oil and Gasoline
>Mixing is a very important part of a successful process and critical for proper operation. Oil and gas don't want to mix and will sit in layers in a tank. It requires vigorous mixing to get the oil blended with the solvent. Poorly mixed oil will go straight to the bottom of a tank and gas or diesel will float on top. If you pour cleaned oil directly into your fuel tank thinking it would blend, WRONG, it is guaranteed your engine will start smoking and running rough within minutes. Also, you can't just put a stick in the tank and swish it around for 5 minutes and expect it to work. Proper mixing is essential if your oil fuel is going to run properly. Small batches up to 100 gallons or so may be vigorously blended with a motorized paddle mixer. Twenty 20 minutes per one hundred gallons should be a minimum. Another option is circulating with a gear pump for a few hours. Once your 80/20 blend is well mixed, it will stay that way.

>Settling
>Air bubbles will be drawn into the oil with all of this vigorous mixing. After blending, the tank should sit overnight to allow the air bubbles to escape. Another good practice is to fill the equipment tanks or engine fuel tanks the evening before use. Any air whipped into the oil during filling will escape overnight.
